# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
## Description
This program was written in Python using the pygame and pygame-gui libraries.

It will generate a specified amount of bars of randomized heights. It will then use a sorting algorithm of the user's choice to sort the bars in chronological order. Users are also able to change the color of the background and bars.

## Future Plans
- Install/Run Instructions
- Support for more sorting algorithms
